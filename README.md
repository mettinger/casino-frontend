# slot machine - frontend

This repository contains frontend code for the ethereum slot machine contract developed
in my other repository: [slotmachine-ethereum](https://github.com/mettinger/slotmachine-ethereum).  

Both repositories are intended to be easily customizable, making it easy to design and deploy new, creative slot machines on Ethereum.

Frontend instructions for creating your custom slot machine:

1.  Put your symbol images, and ONLY your symbol images, in src/assets/symbols.  
2.  Next.
